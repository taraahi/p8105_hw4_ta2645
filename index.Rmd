# Welcome!

### Introduction

My name is Tara and I'm a second-year MPH student at Columbia in the Epidemiology department with a certificate in Comparative Effectiveness Outcomes Research. One of my favorite classes is Data Science I, where I'm learning to make my own websites, which brings you to this landing page. I spend most of my time doing homework and Googling R tools or reading the course website, linked [here](p8105.com). In the precious little spare time I have, I enjoy traveling to new places, reading political biographies, and playing tennis.

I hope you are able to find some interesting information navigating these pages. If you would like to reach out, my contact information is provided.
